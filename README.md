#Consumer Affairs API

Users can submit reviews for different companies and retrieve their own reviews. To accomplish this, users register themselves and are returned an authenticity token. (If users lose/forget this token, they can login using their registered information to get their token.)

###All following actions require the user's authenticity token.
1. Users can submit/create a company for the database.
2. Users can retrieve all companies and their information (useful to finding the company id which is necessary to submitting a review).
3. Users can retrieve one company's information (useful to finding the company id which is necessary to submitting a review) through an exact name search.
4. Users can submit a review for any one company.
5. Users can retrieve all the reviews they've written.

All API routes have been tested with [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/ef9469016f86acb06af1).

A more thorough explanation of all API routes are documented in specifications.txt found in root directory.

Hello Ronald!

My name's ShinYi Tan, and I've been looking forward to potentially joining your team at Consumer Affairs for a while now. I've been in contact with Blake for about a month, but I just wanted to formally introduce myself to you as I know you'll be reviewing my code for the Django API Practical exam soon. Thank you sincerely for taking the time to do so -- I really do appreciate it!

I taught myself Django within the past two weeks in order to take the exam so if you have any feedback regarding the structure of the API or anything else, I'm always learning and would love to hear constructive criticism!

Thank you sincerely for your time in advance,
ShinYi Tan
